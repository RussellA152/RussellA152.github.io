        <p class="lead">Welcome to my bio. I am currently a freshman student at CSULB, soon to be a sophomore student. I hope to graduate in 2024 or 2025 at CSULB and work as either a Video Game Programmer or Video Game Designer, though I'm still not completely sure what I want to do. I have been here for about 22 years. I became a Computer Science Major because I knew that programming was a crucial role in creating video games, and I'm not exactly the best artist or writer. I hope that graduating as a Computer Science major will help me obtain a job in the video game industry. I also joined the VGDA (Video Game Development Association) to become acquainted with other game developers and to get a feel for making my own games and projects.

I've only been the club for a few months and been attending CSULB for a little less than a year, but I'm very much enjoying my time as student and club member at CSULB. Aside from school/career related info, I am 18 years old and the youngest of 4 boys and on my free time I like to play video games with my close friends or watch television with my siblings. I also enjoy hanging out with my two dogs and 1 cat, though my cat is often away from the house on her own journey.</p>
